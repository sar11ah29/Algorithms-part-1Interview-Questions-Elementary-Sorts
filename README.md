Algorithms part 1Interview Questions: Elementary Sorts (Intersection of two sets, Permutation, Dutch national flag )

Question 1
Intersection of two sets. Given two arrays \mathtt{a[]}a[] and \mathtt{b[]}b[], each containing nn distinct 2D points in the plane, design a subquadratic algorithm to count the number of points that are contained both in array \mathtt{a[]}a[] and array \mathtt{b[]}b[].




Question 2
Permutation. Given two integer arrays of size nn, design a subquadratic algorithm to determine whether one is a permutation of the other. That is, do they contain exactly the same entries but, possibly, in a different order.




Question 3
Dutch national flag. Given an array of nn buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color. The allowed operations are:

swap(i, j)swap(i,j):  swap the pebble in bucket ii with the pebble in bucket jj.

color(i)color(i): determine the color of the pebble in bucket ii.

The performance requirements are as follows:

At most nn calls to color()color().

At most nn calls to swap()swap().

Constant extra space.
